                <h5 class="card-title">Revan</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Revan is the main protagonist of Knights of the Old Republic. As the Dark Lord of the Sith and Master of Darth Malak, Revan was led into a trap where a Jedi strike team, led by Bastila Shan, infiltrated his flagship and unknowingly helped by Revan's own apprentice, captured him. Revan was badly wounded and his mind was nearly destroyed from the battle so the Jedi Council, in a bold move, programmed him with a new identity, one that is loyal to the Galactic Republic. Enlisted as a Republic soldier, Revan is caught up in events that lead him to rejoin the Jedi Order as a Padawan and travel the galaxy in search of enigmatic Star Maps in an attempt to foil the efforts of the Sith Empire of the Star Forge. During his journey he is accompanied by various beings who are all determined to help him in his quest, especially Bastila Shan, with whom he developed a Force bond. Along the way, Revan is continuously confronted with situations that test his loyalty to the Jedi Order and the light side of the Force. Inevitably, the amnesiac Revan's memories begin to surface and he unearths his past, hidden from him by the combined efforts of the Jedi Order's lead Masters. The quest reaches a climax atop the Temple of the Ancients on the planet of Lehon, where Revan ultimately rejects the Dark side of the Force and travels to the Star Forge, a large space factory that the Sith Empire is using to construct a conquest fleet, and confronts his former apprentice, Malak. Revan and his companions prove to be victorious and Revan is proclaimed the Prodigal Knight by the Jedi. For his efforts in destroying the Star Forge he is awarded the Republic's highest honor, the Cross of Glory.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Malak</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Darth Malak is introduced as the reigning Dark Lord of his time and is the main antagonist. After following his former Sith Master, Revan, throughout the Mandalorian Wars and even to the dark side of the Force, this former Jedi Knight, believing himself to be stronger and more deserving, usurps Revan's title of Dark Lord, by ordering his own ships to fire upon the Dark Lord while the latter defends himself against the Jedi strike team led by Bastila Shan. Malak felt confident that he would destroy both of his enemies at the same time. With his new position among the Sith, Darth Malak ruthlessly and systematically begins his reign of terror, either subduing or destroying the planets of the galaxy, his forces apparently limitless. Eventually, he learns that Bastila had not died in the attack, and desiring her Battle Meditation, begins a galaxy-wide hunt for her. Time and time again she eludes his capture and Malak becomes intrigued by the rumors of her new companions. Malak charges his Admiral, Saul Karath, with the task of capturing the group, which he does in an ambush from the bridge of Malak's flagship, the Leviathan. Here it is revealed that the now redeemed Revan, in fact, did not die in the attack. In a series of events, Malak is finally able to capture Bastila and turn her to the dark side under continued torture. Retreating to the Star Forge with his new apprentice, Malak fully intends to end the life of his former master and destroy the Republic with Bastila's Battle Meditation. His plans are shattered when Revan is able to bring Bastila back to the light side and he forfeits his life in a final battle with his former master, Revan.</p>

                <p class="card-text">Bastila Shan is a young Jedi Knight proficient from a young age in battle meditation who enters the story after she is saved by Revan from the Black Vulkars on Taris. She leads Revan to the Jedi Academy on Dantooine and encourages the council to take him on as a Jedi Initiate, which they reluctantly agree to do. Bastila and Revan realize that they share a Force bond that allows them to share visions of the Star Maps. Over the course of the party's adventure, she shows signs of rashness and vanity, as well as an attraction to Revan that culminates in a kiss aboard the Ebon Hawk. She is captured aboard the Leviathan after it is revealed that she preserved Revan's life after Malak betrayed Revan. She is tortured for several days by Darth Malak himself in an attempt to turn her to the dark side. He is successful, as Revan finds out atop the Temple of the Ancients when she tries in vain to convince him to join her. He refuses, and she flees from him to the Star Forge. Inside the space station, she uses her battle meditation to assist the Sith fleet while rendering the Republic forces less effective. Revan fights his way to her and they engage in a long duel. Revan overpowers her several times and uses their bond and love for one another to turn her away from the dark side. She then uses her battle meditation against the Sith fleet and is awarded the Cross of Glory in the end for assisting the Republic Fleet.</p>

The years since have not been kind to Taris, as vegetation and animal life struggle to gain a foothold in shattered skyscrapers and habitats. The Republic began to recolonize Taris less than a decade ago, aiming to make it into a symbol of Republic hope and steadfastness. In response, the Empire is mobilizing troops and beginning a full-scale assault. Early reports speak of fierce resistance from the Republic, as well as natural hazards in the form of wildlife and the mysterious "rakghoul plague"."</p>

Only a few settlements dot Tatooine's endless wastes, inhabited by handfuls of traders and moisture farmers. Tatooine's obscurity has also attracted a small but significant criminal population, here to hide from galactic authorities. Tatooine lacks any central government or allegiance to Republic or Empire. There are rumors of an Imperial occupation taking place in one of the frontier settlements, but nothing has been confirmed."</p>
